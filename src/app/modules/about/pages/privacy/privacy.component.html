    <p>We donâ€™t store any of your data. All data is stored in your local browser and (optionally) your cloud storage
      account.</p>

    <h4>Google/Dropbox account permissions</h4>
    <p>
      When you connect your storage to Google Drive/Dropbox, the app will request an "authorization token" from
      Google/Dropbox that is sent directly to the app and stored on your device only, it does not go though our servers.
      This way we have no way to access your account's information or data. This "authorization token" is the one used
      by
      the app to communicate to the Google Drive or Dropbox APIs on behalf of your Google or Dropbox account,
      respectively. The "authorization token" grants the app read & write access to all your files and folders in your
      Google Drive/Dropbox account, since there is no option to request access to a single folder, however the app will
      only access and modify files in the "remotestorage" folder. No other data or user info from your Google/Dropbox
      account is accessed by the app.
    </p>

    <h4>RemoteStorage service provider account permissions</h4>
    <p>When you connect your storage to a RemoteStorage service provider, the app will request an "authorization token"
      from your provider that is sent directly to the app and stored on your device only, it does not go though our
      servers. This way we have no way to access your account's information or data. This "authorization token" is the
      one used by the app to communicate to your RemoteStorage provider on behalf of your account. The "authorization
      token" grants the app read & write access to "roadtofire" and "asset-portfolio" folders in your storage account.
